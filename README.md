This repository contains the underlying XML files for [GEORGIAN MANUSCRIPTS](https://georgian.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/), a catalogue of Georgian materials held at the Bodleian Libraries, and [Wardrops' Collection Online (WCO)](https://manuscript.iliauni.edu.ge/), a digital repository devoted to the Wardrops' Collection of Georgian manuscripts preserved at the Bodleian Library.

Structure:

- [collections](collections/) contains the TEI P5 manuscript description and transcription files
- [processing](processing/) contains any scripts to convert or process them
- [authority](authority/) contains local authority files which determine what is indexed (and how) on the web site
- [archive](working/) contains a copy of the TEI files before conversion

Documentation for cataloguing and maintaining authority files will be made available shortly.
